Luckily, they have a bar at front of house and we were able to get cocktails while we waited.

A beautifully designed space filled with tradition and simple, yet elegant old-world beauty.  The food is not that bad either.  The salads are fresh and simple (I highly recommend the Kokkari salad with roasted strawberries).  The meats are well done and beautifully prepared.  A reservation is highly recommended unless you're lucky enough to find bar seating as I was.",

While parking in the area can be pricey ($8/hour!), a quick 7-8 minute walk northeast leads to free street parking and gives you a chance to explore the neighborhood.\n\nThe food was fantastic! I started with the Hog Island oysters, which were incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, without a hint of fishiness. Next, I tried the garlic grilled oysters, cooked to perfection - juicy, creamy, and infused with garlicky goodness. The old bay fries were another highlight - crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with a hint of sweetness. Even the ketchup impressed me - tangy and refreshing, it complemented the fries perfectly.\n\nThe clam chowder wasn't your typical version. Instead of small bits, it showcased plump whole clams in a slightly thinner, yet still creamy broth that avoided being overly milky.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. Plus, considering the high quality of the food, the prices were very reasonable. This hidden gem, even amidst the tourist crowds, offers excellent value and deserves a visit!",

The clam chowder had a lighter soup to it while the mussels had a thicker stronger taste. Both were wiped out with the bread. The oysters were super fresh. Perfect. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again. There will be a line to queue in. But it was worth it as we were then seated at the table facing Bay Bridge and not facing the queue. It was such a good lunch. In total we spent about usd100 each. There were two of us. If you had more people the cost would be lower.",
